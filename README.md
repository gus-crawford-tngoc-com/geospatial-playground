# Assessment

We've created a contemporary full-stack solution:

## Angular UI

An Angular application called ["assessment"](./assessment/README.md).

1. It gets ZIP codes from MongoDB documentation and allows filtering of them on screen.
3. We ask to unit-test `search(...)`, with mocking one injectible.
2. There are leaks designed into the main component we ask to solve.


## Nest Backend

1. It loads a giant set of ZIP codes into a mongo database on launch.
2. It can filter entries by ZIP, city, or state.

## Administer

1. Use your computer and run `code assesment`.
2. Create a branch with the _candidate's_ name.
    - Edit üìÑ package.json in the üìÅ assessment folder and change the `"start"` script's `--port` argument to a unique value for the applicant, _then commit on their branch_.
3. Run `npm start` and have them checkout the app-front page:
    - _Enter their name_ this will record their name and a "time of start" in local-storage on the browswer.
    - They can add their written answers inline on the page (also storing to local storage, and a stop time when "done" is clicked) or write these in their project README if that is more comfortable.
4. Test coverage by running `npm test` (`npm run coverage` in assessment) and [reviewing](./assessment/coverage/assessment/) that both branches of code in `search` are covered.
